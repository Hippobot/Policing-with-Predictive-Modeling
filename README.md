In Charlotte, NC, predictive policing can strategically address the surge in vehicle thefts,
particularly at private residences, thereby enhancing the efficiency of resource distribution and
the effectiveness of preventative measures. A strong correlation exists between socioeconomic
indicators such as poverty and unemployment rates and the incidence of vehicle-related theft;
targeted interventions in these areas may lead to a decline in crime rate. Incorporating and refining predictive policing models can result in favorable outcomes in the future.
