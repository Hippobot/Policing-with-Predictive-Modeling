# Policing-with-Predictive-Modeling
Crime involving vehicle-related theft is a pervasive and growing issue in urban areas across the United States. We seek to analyze how predictive modeling fits into the landscape of policing.

Models/Tools used include: XG-Boost, Random Forest, ArcGIS

In Charlotte, NC, predictive policing can strategically address the surge in vehicle thefts,
particularly at private residences, thereby enhancing the efficiency of resource distribution and
the effectiveness of preventative measures. A strong correlation exists between socioeconomic
indicators such as poverty and unemployment rates and the incidence of vehicle-related theft;
targeted interventions in these areas may lead to a decline in crime rate. Incorporating and refining predictive policing models can result in favorable outcomes in the future.


Key Takeaways:

In Charlotte, NC, predictive policing can strategically address the surge in vehicle thefts,
particularly at private residences, thereby enhancing the efficiency of resource distribution and
the effectiveness of preventative measures. A strong correlation exists between socioeconomic
indicators such as poverty and unemployment rates and the incidence of vehicle-related theft;
targeted interventions in these areas may lead to a decline in crime rate. Incorporating ethical
considerations into predictive policing is crucial to prevent the perpetuation of existing social
and economic inequalities within the community.

For the Future:

Throughout this research, many lessons were learned on how the project could be
improved through further iteration. The research could be refined further through the variables
by increasing granularity and reducing non-linearity through binning, as previously mentioned
with the ‘Census_Tract_Poverty_Rate’ and ‘Median_Household_Income’ variables. Considering
research of this nature, increased and more involved data collection also has the potential to tune
23
the project for its direct purpose since most of the crime data for research was already provided.
Lastly, further iterations would see improvement in a more precise, more defined problem
statement and additional assessment of the chosen target variable in both application and
purpose
